There are so many Machine Learning Tutorials too. However, there is no one easy to follow Machine Learning-ML Cloud Service-Local Development-Benchmarking Workflow. I am going to talk about three Free services which any person can use with basic internet access - Google Colaboratory (for ML Cloud Service), VS Code (Local ML Development) and Weights and Biases (for benchmarking). TL;DR- This is a process guide for deploying your ML models as a researcher! What won’t you learn? How to code in Python or develop Machine Leaning Models or learn Pytorch. What will you learn? How to contribute code to a well-structured projects Work with multiple Google Colaboratory Notebooks Create easy Python Documentation Scale up as your project and team grows in complexity and size Benchmark and Project Tracking "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Python and Google Colaboratory", " Chapter 2 Python and Google Colaboratory You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2020) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015).

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com. When you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: summary(cars) ## speed dist ## Min. : 4.0 Min. : 2.00 ## 1st Qu.:12.0 1st Qu.: 26.00 ## Median :15.0 Median : 36.00 ## Mean :15.4 Mean : 42.98 ## 3rd Qu.:19.0 3rd Qu.: 56.00 ## Max. :25.0 Max. :120.00 7.2 Including Plots You can also embed plots, for example: Note that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
